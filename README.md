# Meme Stock Volatility Prediction using Reddit Sentiment Analysis
Introduction
This project investigates how sentiment in Reddit discussions, particularly those focused on "meme stocks," influences stock volatility. Meme stocks are highly volatile stocks, often driven by online hype rather than traditional market indicators. The aim is to predict the stock volatility using sentiment analysis from Reddit data combined with historical volatility data.

Objectives
Sentiment Analysis: Extract sentiment from Reddit posts related to meme stocks.
Stock Volatility Prediction: Use sentiment data and historical stock data to train an LSTM model to predict future stock volatility.
Evaluation: Analyze the performance of the prediction model using visualizations of actual and predicted volatility.
Data Sources
Reddit Sentiment Data: Collected using the PRAW library to scrape posts related to meme stocks.
Stock Data: Retrieved from yfinance for meme stocks like AMC, GME, etc.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
PRAW: Reddit API for sentiment data.
NLTK: For sentiment analysis.
yfinance: For stock data extraction.
pandas, numpy: Data manipulation libraries.
tensorflow: For training LSTM models.
matplotlib, seaborn: Visualization libraries.
Methodology
1. Data Collection
Reddit Scraping: We collected comments and posts related to popular meme stocks from Reddit using the PRAW API.
Stock Data: Historical stock prices and volatility for the meme stocks were fetched using the yfinance library.
2. Sentiment Analysis
We performed sentiment analysis on the Reddit comments using VADER from the nltk library.
Each post's sentiment was quantified with a sentiment score ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).
3. Feature Engineering
Merged the stock data with sentiment data.
Created new features such as daily average sentiment, sentiment volatility, etc., to enrich the dataset for model training.
4. Modeling
An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was selected due to its effectiveness in capturing temporal dependencies in time-series data.
The LSTM model was trained using both historical stock data and the corresponding sentiment data to predict stock volatility.
5. Evaluation
We evaluated the model's performance by plotting the training loss and visualizing actual vs predicted volatility values.
Results
Training Loss Visualization
The plot below shows the training loss over the epochs, indicating that the model was learning effectively, with the loss steadily decreasing.


Actual vs Predicted Volatility
This plot compares the actual volatility of the stock versus the predicted volatility generated by the LSTM model.

The closeness of the curves indicates how well the model was able to track the real stock volatility based on Reddit sentiment and stock historical data.

Conclusion
The results indicate a correlation between Reddit sentiment and stock volatility, suggesting that sentiment in online communities can be a valuable predictor for meme stocks. The LSTM model was successful in capturing these trends, though future improvements could include:

Using more complex NLP techniques for sentiment analysis (e.g., transformer models like BERT).
Incorporating other data sources like Twitter or news sentiment to improve model accuracy.
Future Work
Expand Data Sources: Include other social media platforms and news data for a more comprehensive view.
Improve Model Accuracy: Try alternative models or more complex architectures such as transformer-based models.
Real-Time Predictions: Set up a system to continuously scrape Reddit and provide real-time volatility predictions.
